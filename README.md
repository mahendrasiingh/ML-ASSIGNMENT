## 🧠 Problem Statement

A retail company wants to improve its marketing strategy by understanding its customers better. One solution is to **segment customers** into meaningful groups based on purchasing behavior (e.g., frequency of purchase, amount spent, etc.). This assignment implements a **KMeans clustering algorithm** to accomplish this.

## 🗂️ Dataset

For this assignment:
- A simulated dataset of 10 customers was created
- Features used:  
  - `Frequency`: Number of purchases  
  - `AmountSpent`: Total amount spent  
  - `ProductType`: Encoded product category  
  - `Recency`: Days since last purchase  

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Created a sample dataset of customer behavior
   - Removed unnecessary columns (`CustomerID`)
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalized data using `StandardScaler`
3. **Modeling**
   - Applied `KMeans` clustering with 3 clusters
4. **Evaluation**
   - Measured clustering quality using **Silhouette Score**
5. **Visualization**
   - Visualized clusters using scatter plots

---

## 🔍 Libraries Used

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  

---

## 📈 Results

- Clusters were successfully formed based on customer purchasing behavior
- A **Silhouette Score** was used to measure clustering performance

---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run all the cells in order
3. Visualizations and cluster assignments will be displayed at the end
